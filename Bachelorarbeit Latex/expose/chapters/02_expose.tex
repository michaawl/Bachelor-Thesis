%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Your text here\ldots
\TODO{Write an exposé to have your ideas on paper (not in your mind only) when discussing your thesis with your tutor. It can be improved at any time. Describe in about  two to four pages your overall ideas, the innovation, the method, the results and implications.}

\section{Thesis Statement \& Problem Description} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

...

% Introduction
% Context
% What is the problem?
% Why is it a problem?
% What is unknown?
% What could be improved?


% YOUR IDEAS, AIMS, & RESULTS:
% What is the goal of the project?
% Target groups: who will benefit?

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Research Questions and Hypotheses} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% i.e. include two or three research questions (RQs)

...

% What are the hypotheses that are to be investigated?
% Which results should be achieved with the project? How will you evaluate the results?

%%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%% %%%%%%%
% If you struggle writing RQs, you might try following three-step approach:

% (1) "see" a problem
% 	  detect a (generalisable) problem, give examples, 
%     state the relevance of the problem 
%           (i.e. for whom it is a problem in which context)
%     e.g.: for remote help using video chats (WebRTC) one has to 
%           explain verbally the location of a problem within a picture/video

% (2) Have an idea:
% 	  = create an hypothesis. For example: if we would mark an area in the
%     image/video (e.g. by overlaying image with arrows/pointers and by showing 
%     object names detected through machine learning) the 
%     communication between video chat participants would be more efficient.

% (3) write down in one (long sentence) the research question (RQ), such as:
%     To which extend / in which way / by combining ... 
%     one can improve/optimise/speed-up/... the existing / the given .... 

% (...) then, the planning/performing/writing of your thesis will be easy:
%	  (thesis = show in a reproducible way that the idea will work)
%     research, analyse alternatives, state success criteria, create concepts, 
%     implement (a prototype), evaluate according to criteria, 
%     reflect on your work

%\section{Theories and Sensitising Concepts} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


...

% What results and approaches have already been presented in this or related areas?
% Description and critical discussion of related scientific work (Harvard Citation Style!)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Method} 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

...

% How should the expected results (your plans, your ideas) be achieved 
%      to solve the described problem at hand?
% What method(s) will be applied? (e.g., empirical study, user-centred design, 
%      prototype implementation; performance tests, interviews, Likert scale, 
%      latency etc.)

\section{Related Work}

...
Researchers have to learn to adhere to scientific research rules \citep[cf.][45ff.]{Booth:2008} and train to write with style \citep[cf.][pp. 145--48]{Strunk:2000}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Annotated list of resources}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% explain your research method
%             try to find at least two related ACM / IEEE papers
%             https://dl.acm.org / https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/


... 
% List of cited literature in form of annotated bibliography
% at least 4 relevant references in form of an annotated bibliography

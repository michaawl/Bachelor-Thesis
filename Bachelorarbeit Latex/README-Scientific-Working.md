Scientific Working Hints
========================

Check the English writing conventions.
	
* Grammar: 
	+ Switch on your **spellchecker**!!
	+ Check out the **Capitalisation Rules**: <https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case> or <https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/capitalization/rules-for-capitalization-in-titles.html> 
* Style: 
	+ avoid ```a lot of```
	+ never write HOMEPAGE => it is called **WEBSITE** 
	+ avoid ```gets```
	+ use "Full-Text" (not "free-text" or "full text")
	+ avoid ```the tool allows to``` => better ```the tool supports the```

	
* Passive voice
	+ e.g.: ```Listing x shows```
	
* Dashes
	* dash with: ```
	three-dimensional```, ```object-oriented```, ```specific higher-level structures```, ```colour-code```,  ```sense-making```, ```web-based```, ```pre-test questionnaire```, ... 	
* Doubledashes: avoid --, use comma
	* avoid abc -- XYZ -- cde 
	* better abc, XYZ, cde 
	
* Comma 
	+ before ```and```: e.g. ```audio, video, and screencasts``` 

* Numbers / Amount
	* number of changes <= countable! 

* Time
	* describe a study in **PAST TIME**	 (finished) not *PRESENT PERFECT* (some continuation)
	* NOT *have been*: ```tools have been analysed```
	* BUT **were**: ```tools were analysed```

* Naming and (scientific) Terms
	* **future work** (betther than *outlook*)


* Stick to BE (british english):
	* colour <= BE
	* centre <= BE 


* Uppercase/Lowercase
	* all up in titles (but: to, the,....) 
	* even after - : Server-Side JavaScript


* Footnotes: avoid footnotes
	* better put references (urls) in biblio 

* Keywords
	* all keywords should be part of the title and the abstract


* References / Related Work
	* explain the **results** of related research
	* writing style (*compare*):
		* avoid: ```...compare Madrigal and ...```
		* better use: ```...in contrast, Madrigal and ...```
	* writing style (*see*):
		* avoid: ```...formative usability evaluation, see \textcite{Redish:2002}, ...```
		* better use: ```...\textcite{Redish:2002} describe formative usability evaluation...```

	* Permissions = Copyright = Using Text/Images from 
		* [IEEE](https://www.ieee.org/content/dam/ieee-org/ieee/web/org/pubs/permissions_faq.pdf): *Does IEEE require individuals working on a thesis or dissertation to obtain formal permission for reuse?*

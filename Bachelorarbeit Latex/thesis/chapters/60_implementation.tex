\TODO{Describe what is relevant and special about your working prototype. 
State how single features help to solve problem(s) at hand. You might 
implement only the most relevant features. Features you select from your
prioritised feature list assembled in Chapter \ref{chap:concept}. Focus 
novel, difficult, or innovative aspects of your prototype. Add visuals such 
as architectures, diagrams, flows, tables, screenshots to illustrate your 
work. Select interesting code snippets, e.g. of somewhat complicated 
algorithms, to present them as source code listings.}

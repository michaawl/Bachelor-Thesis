\TODO{Add acronyms (abbreviations) and their long version. In the text the
first occurrence will show the full description, further occurrences will 
show the acronym only.}

% In your text use macro \ac all the time.
%   E.g.  \ac{MITM}
% Note for pretty printing the list of acronyms:
%   First, find out which one will be the longest (here e.g. KISS or MITM).
%   Then, specify as many chars (e.g. 4 Ms) such as \begin{acronym}[MMMM].
\footnotesize
\begin{acronym}[MMMM]

  % MUST be sorted manually:
  \acro{ABI}  {Application Binary Interface}
  \acro{DOI}  {Digital Object Identifier}
  \acro{ISBN} {International Standard Book Number}
  \acro{MITM} {Man-In-The-Middle}
  \acro{URL}  {Universal Resource Locator}
  

  %
  % You get warnings for unused acronyms, so better disable them
  %
  %\acro{ACL} {Access Control List}
  %\acro{GUI} {Graphical User Interface}
  %\acro{KISS}{Keep It Small and Simple}
  %\acro{OS}  {Operating System}
  %\acro{UART}{Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter}
  %\acro{UID} {Unique Identifier}

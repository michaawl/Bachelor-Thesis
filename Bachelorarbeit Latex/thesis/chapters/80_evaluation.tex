\TODO{Describe (proof) how your implementation really solved the stated problem. 
I.e. accept or reject your hypotheses. Provide a range of input data sets. 
Run experiments and gather the output (of tools) to meter your prototype. For 
the analysis, collect the measurement-data, process (e.g. filter) data and interpret
the data. Include an interpretation of the work. What do the results mean to you?
State current limitations of your solution. Give (personal) interpretation where
suitable. Your own opinion is relevant, but must be marked clearly as such.
